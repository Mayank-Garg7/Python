# Find the length of the string
text = input("Enter the text : ")

# Approach 1 Using loop
# count = 0
# for i in text:
#     count = count + 1
# print(f"The length of text is : {count}")


# Approach 2 Using len method
# print(f"The length of text is : {len(text)}")


# Approach 3 Using count method
# text1 = "x"
# print(f"The length of text is : {(text1).join(text).count(text1)+1}")


# Approach 4 Using while loop and slicing
# count = 0
# while text[count: ]:
#     count = count + 1
# print(f"The length of text is : {count}")
