# How to search a element in a list
arr = [3,5,1,7,8,0,2,9]
print(arr)
element = int(input("Enter the value for finding : "))

# Approach 1 Using loop
# tell = False
# for i in arr:
#     if element == i:
#         tell = True
# if tell == True:
#     print(f"{element} is found in the list ")
# else:
#     print(f"{element} is not found in the list")



# Approach 2 Using in operator
# if element in arr :
#     print(f"{element} is found in the list")
# else:
#     print(f"{element} is not found in the list")
