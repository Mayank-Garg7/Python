# How to clear the list
arr = [3,5,2,7,9,7,1,0]
print(f"List before clear : {arr}")

# Approach 1 Using clear method
# arr.clear()
# print(f"List after clear : {arr}")

# Approach 2 Initiallizing no value to the list
# arr = []
# print(f"List after clear : {arr}")

# arr *= 0
# print(f"List after clear {arr}")


# Approach 4 Using del
