# How to multiply all the elements of the list
arr = [3,5,2,7,9,7,1,7]
print(f"List : {arr}")


# Approach 1 Using  for loop 
# product = 1
# for i in range(0, len(arr)):
#     product = product*arr[i]
# print(f"Multiplication of all the number is : {product}")


# Approach 2 Using numpy.prod() method
# import numpy as nm
# print(f"Multiplication of all the number is : {nm.prod(arr)}")
