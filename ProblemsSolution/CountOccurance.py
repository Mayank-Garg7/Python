# Count the occurance of the element in the list

arr = [3,5,2,7,9,7,1,7]
print(f"List including all the elements : {arr}")
a = int(input("Enter the value which is occured in more than one time : "))

# Approach 1 Using for and if statement
# count = 0
# for i in range(0, len(arr)):
#     if a == arr[i]:
#         count = count+1
# print(f"{a} is appear {count} times")


# Approach 2 Using count method
# count = arr.cnt(a)
# print(f"{a} is appear {count} times")ount(a)
# print(f"{a} is appear {count} times")


# Approach 3 Using Counter method, in this method there is no need of input**
# from collections import Counter
# dic = Counter(arr)
# print(f"Appearance of values are given here : {dic}")
