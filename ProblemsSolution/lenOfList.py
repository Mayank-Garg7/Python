# Find the length of list
# Input arr = [10,20,30,40,50,60]
# Output 6
MyList = [10,20,30,40,50,60]
print(MyList)

# Approach 1
# count = 0
# for i in MyList:
#     count = count +1
# print(f"The length of above list is : {count}")

# Approach 2
# print(f"The length of above list is : {len(MyList)}")
