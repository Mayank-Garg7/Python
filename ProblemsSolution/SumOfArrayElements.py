# Find the sum of Elements in Array but in python there is list instead of Array 
# For example = input [3,5,4,7,8]
# 3+5+4+7+8 = 27
# Outpu 27
arr = [3,4,5,6,2,8]

# Approach 1
# print(sum(arr))


# Approach 2
# sum = 0
# for i in range(0,len(arr)):
#     sum = sum + arr[i]
# print(f"The sum of entered values is {sum}")
