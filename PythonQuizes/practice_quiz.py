# PRACTICE 1ST Make a function and call it
# def greet(name):
#     print("Good day "+name)
# greet("mayank")


# PRACTICE 2nd find the factorial by using function
# def factorial(n):
#     fact = 1
#     for i in range(1, a+1):
#         fact = fact*i
#     return fact
# a = int(input("Enter the number : "))
# print(factorial(a))


# PRACTICE 3rd find the factorial by using recursive function
# def rec_fact(n):
#     if n == 1 or n == 0:
#         return 1
#     return n * rec_fact(n-1)
# a = int(input("Enter the number : "))
# print(rec_fact(a))
